            Features vectors are created using Bag of Words and other aspects of each sentence (such as similar
            sentences discovered with KMeans clustering). After a small amount of user input, a Random Forest classifies
            sentences before the combination is output.

            Created over 4 days as 3 engineers with no flutter or mobile experience. In addition to approving <a

                href="https://www.entranceconsulting.com/what-is-an-authorization-for-expenditure">AFEs</a>
            normally, we implemented three additional "game" modes. A <a target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command">Missile Command</a> mode that approves AFEs if
            they reach the ground, a
            shakewight mode for a quick workout, and a cardstack swiping mode to meet single
            AFEs looking for approval in your area.

        <ul>
            <li>Developed mobile AFE app with Flutter using Android Studio in 1 week</li>
            <li>Implemented card stack approval mode (think Tinder) and parsed REST APIs to personify the AFEs</li>
