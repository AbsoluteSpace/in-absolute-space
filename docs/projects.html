            Features vectors are created using Bag of Words and other aspects of each sentence (such as similar
            sentences discovered with KMeans clustering). After a small amount of user input, a Random Forest classifies
            sentences before the combination is output.

            Created over 4 days as 3 engineers with no flutter or mobile experience. In addition to approving <a

            normally, we implemented three additional "game" modes. One, a <a target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command">Missile Command</a> mode that approves AFEs if
            they reach the ground, a
            shakewight mode for a quick workout, and a cardstack swiping mode to meet single
            AFEs looking for approval in your area.

        <ul>
            <li>A mobile AFE approval app built with Flutter</li>
            <li>I built a cardstack approval mode (think Tinder) as well as dynamic theming</li>
