## You are now in Absolute Space

I'm Erik and I'm a Computer Science and Physics new grad (well, soon: April 2021) from the University of British Columbia with software engineering experience as an intern at 3 different companies. 

This repository is [my website](https://inabsolutespace.com/) and officialy it suplements my resume, but I've been really excited to do this for awhile so I'm excited to see where I push this.
