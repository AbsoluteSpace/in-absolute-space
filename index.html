    <h1>Hello! I'm Erik.</h1>

    <p>I'm a Computer Science and Physics new grad (well, soon: April 2021) from the University of British
        Columbia with software engineering experience as an intern at 3 different companies.</p>

    <p>I really like building cool things quickly, and some things that interest me right now are machine learning,
        information retrieval, arm wrestling and nuclear physics. I'm looking for new opportunities, so please contact
        me if you'd like to know more!</p>
