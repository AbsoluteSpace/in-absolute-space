    <h1>Hello! I'm Erik.</h1>

    <p>I'm a Computer Science and Physics new grad from the University of British
        Columbia (UBC) with software engineering experience as an intern at 3 different companies and machine learning
        teaching experience at UBC.</p>

    <p>I really like building cool things quickly, and some things that interest me right now are machine learning,
        e-commerce, nuclear physics, and arm wrestling. I'm looking for new opportunities, so please contact
        me if you'd like to know more!</p>
